# Escalation Workflow Optimization Using Root Cause Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the rising escalation rate within a contact center support environment and proposes a redesigned workflow aimed at reducing delays, improving routing accuracy, and increasing customer satisfaction. The work includes root-cause analysis, workflow mapping, impact modeling, and future-state process recommendations.

---

## Objectives
- Identify root causes behind increasing escalation trends  
- Map the existing workflow and operational pain points  
- Propose an optimized workflow supported by automation and routing logic  
- Model the expected business impact using measurable KPIs  

---

## Scope
This analysis focuses on:

- Phone and chat support operations  
- Escalation handling structure  
- Knowledge base influence on resolution accuracy  
- Routing, approval logic, and agent workflows

## Methodology
- Fishbone Diagram  
- 5 Whys Analysis  
- Workflow Mapping  
- KPI Modeling and Scenario Simulation  
- Business Requirements Documentation (BRD)  

---

## Findings Summary
The primary drivers of escalation growth were:

- Multiple handoffs and approval layers  
- Outdated knowledge content causing inconsistent responses  
- Lack of automated routing or categorization logic  
- High dependency on supervisors for resolution authority  

---

## Proposed Improvements
- Automated triage logic to categorize issues at intake  
- Smart routing to assign tickets to specialized queues  
- Reduced approval layers for standard cases  
- Continuous knowledge base updates based on issue patterns  

---

## Projected Impact

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Escalation Rate | 11.8% | <5% |
| Resolution Time | 9.1 min | ~7.2 min |
| First Touch Resolution | 61% | 75–80% |
| Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) | 3.6 / 5 | ≥ 4.2 / 5 |

---

## Conclusion
The redesigned workflow focuses on eliminating operational bottlenecks that trigger escalations rather than managing escalations reactively. With automation, streamlined routing, and improved knowledge management, the support experience becomes faster, more consistent, and scalable.
